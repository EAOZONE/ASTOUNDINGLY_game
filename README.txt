How to Play
Press space to begin or 1 to view the instructions on the home screen
Once space has been pressed you will be prompted to choose a number of levels of play up to 8
As well as the number of guesses per level up to 6
After they have been chosen the game begins
You can either input a five-letter word or be given a hint
To input a five-letter word type all five letters out and hit enter
If the word is in the dictionary you will be given hints about each letter
Whether they are in the word and in the right spot, in the wrong spot, or not in the word
You may continue guessing until you have guessed the word or you may ask for a hint
To ask for a hint hit the number 2 and a letter that you have not been given yet will become yellow
The game continues until you are stumped at the word and can not get it in the number of guesses
or you have gotten all the words and you are victorious.

Features
Make sure to always be using the hint button when you are stumped as it only adds one guess to your final total
If you want a nice fun game of wordle choose 1 level and 6 guesses
Or if you want an intense game choose 8 levels and 3 or less guesses
